# suggestion_bot
## !!! This is a WIP repository
 Suggestion bot v2.0, will be a complete rewrite of the current bot and will have the following planned features:
 - Slash commands with suggestion type
 - In-depth command system to manage suggestions (also using slash commands)
 - Multichannel system to make approved/denied/in-progress/implemented suggestions clear and easy to track for users
 - Cached messages so that restaring the bot won't break the approve/deny system
 - Easy set up with commands for channels and roles/users
 - Maybe (VERY big maybe) add some AI implementation to prevent repeated suggestions
