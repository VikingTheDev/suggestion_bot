# suggestion_bot
 
 This is a work in progress suggestion bot script, although this is technically v2.0 it is a complete rewrite with a ton of planned new features:
 - Slash commands with suggestion type
 - In-depth command system to manage suggestions (also using slash commands)
 - Multichannel system to make approved/denied/implemented suggestions clear and easy to track for users
 - Cached messages so that restaring the bot won't break the approve/deny system
 - Easy set up with commands for channels and roles/users
 - Maybe (VERY big maybe) add some AI implementation to prevent repeat suggestions
